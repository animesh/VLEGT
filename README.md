# Very Little Evolutionary Game Theory

Summary: Five 2-hour Lectures demonstrating how simple models of strategic interaction illuminate important topics in the evolution of animal behavior.

Instructor: Richard McElreath

Location: MPI-EVA Leipzig, main lecture hall

Time: Tuesdays 10am-12pm

Dates: 4 Oct, 11 Oct, 1 Nov, 8 Nov, 15 Nov

Audience: Students and researchers at MPI-EVA and iDiv. If there is space, other Leipzig folks welcome.

Specifics: Lectures will be chalk-on-slate and show the construction and solution of the most basic and famous results of evolutionary game theory. I'll provide extensive notes to accompany the lectures, but you'll still want a notebook to copy the board work during class. There will be algebra. But no calculus or advanced math required. 

Credit: There will be a single homework problem each week that will help you solidify the lecture material and practice extending it. Students who complete all of the assignments can earn course credit.

Topical outline:
Lecture 1. The evolution of conflict<br>
Lecture 2. The evolution of cooperation<br>
Lecture 3. The evolution of relationships<br>
Lecture 4. The evolution of families<br>
Lecture 5. The evolution of societies
